#CoasterPoll
CoasterPoll is a website that aims to create an accurate representation 
of the best roller coasters in the world.
###What the heck is this repo for?
This is the software that runs CoasterPoll.com. 
Everything from users, to tracking coasters someone's ridden, to
displaying everything we know about that coaster/park.
###Why is it on GitHub?
This is made open source under the MIT license because I have nothing to hide,
and might even get some help! I'm writing this for the enthusiast community, not
for any kind of personal gain, so open source makes sense with that goal.

I'm using GitHub because that's where everything seems to be. But not for the 
features like pull requests. All pull requests on GitHub will be denied.
###How can *I* contribute? Why should I?
You might be interested because you like having something to contribute to, to make better.
And we can definitely use some help making things better.

The most up to date documentation is available on [Phabricator](https://cstrpl.tech/u/contribute), 
where all of our documentation, issues, and code is hosted. The process is still being developed.
###WTF. PHP? Really?
Yes. Because that's what allowed me to get started quickly, easily, and had a good support group.
Hate on it all you want, but if it's good enough for Facebook and Wikipedia, I think we can make it work.

That's not to say I'm not willing to look into building components in something new, this is just
what I have that I'm comfortable with. I like learning new things, so if building a new component
(or microservice???) in a new language is something I'm interested in.
###I have lots of questions.
I have lots of answers?
